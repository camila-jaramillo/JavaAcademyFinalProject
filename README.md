```

Take into account the following tips:
- **Contract** The contract could be *Full time* or *Part time*.
- **Experience:** The experience could be in *years*, *months* or *days*, and you should write it like this *3 years*, using the amount of experience, and also, the type of experience.
- **Teacher id:** The *teacher id* is autogenerated in code.

## Students

For adding or modyfing students, you should use ***students.txt*** file. So it's structure is this:

```
Student name
```

Take into account the following tips:
- **Student id:** The *student id* is autogenerated in code.

## Classrooms

For adding or modyfing classrooms, you should use ***classrooms.txt*** file. So it's structure is this:

```
